For no real reason today I remmeber that there used to be this cool program back in the Windows 3.0 days called Neko.  I was trying to explain it to my girlfriend about this cat that would chase your mouse!

I recal that Neko even made it to OS/2 as it was more interesting then the mouse trails alternative from Microsoft.

At any rate, I was wondering if there ever was a 32bit version of Neko... And much to my amazement I found there was a Neko95, and a Neko98!  And they even ran on my x64 version of Windows...  So after googling around, I found the source code to Neko 98!

So I did the next best thing, which is download the source, fix a single casting 'error' in some square root function and I got it building under Visual C++ 2008.

Then I figured, what the hell, added a target for the x64, and built... a 64 bit version of neko!

I've included the x64 release binaries, and the source directory that I used.

You may need some VC runtimes if your system is an old x64...

At this moment it can be found here:

Oh well at any rate, it's cool to see Neko still kicking!
