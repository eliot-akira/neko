                    for   Windows 3.0




	Neko is a small cat that runs in a Window or on the Desktop 
        and follows the mouse cursor. (if you run the first Neko as 
        icon, Neko will use the Desktop.) 

	There may be problems if you run Neko together with other
	programmes that will attach the Desktop (like FUSE).






	options:

   	spleen: (0-100)   Nekos has a spleen!!  
                                                (0 = never, 100 = often)
   	egoism: (1-100)   How long is his tour?
                                                (1 = short, 100 = long)
   	black Neko:       Try!







   	the story:

	I think the original was programmed on a Mac. I found the source
 	of the program (X11-version) on a sun. Jo Mei! At that time i
	had to test my new SDK for Win3.0 and this was the result.
	The options and the abillity to run on the desktop are added
	later. 

	
	The END.
